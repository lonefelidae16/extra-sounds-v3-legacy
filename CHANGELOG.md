### 👷 Technical

* **Huge refactoring has been performed.**
  - class `net.minecraft.sound.SoundEvent` is not compatible between 1.21.1 and 1.21.2,
    so we should use a new wrapper class; named [`VersionedSoundEventWrapper`](./logics/src/main/java/dev/stashy/extrasounds/logics/runtime/VersionedSoundEventWrapper.java).
    This change affects all mod developers who use this mod as a library.
  - If code exists that has references any static fields defined in [`Sounds.java`](./logics/src/main/java/dev/stashy/extrasounds/sounds/Categories.java)
    or [`Categories.java`](logics/src/main/java/dev/stashy/extrasounds/sounds/Categories.java),
    please modify the type definition to `VersionedSoundEventWrapper` and re-compile it.
  - To instantiate `VersionedSoundEventWrapper`, call `VersionedSoundEventWrapper#newInstance(Identifier)`
    or `VersionedSoundEventWrapper#fromBlockState(BlockState)`.
* Dependency updates:
  - yarn mappings 1.21.4+build.1
  - fabric api 0.110.5
  - fabric loader 0.16.9
  - fabric loom 1.9
  - Gradle 8.11.1
  - MidnightControls 1.10.1
  - SoundCategories
* API specification updates:
  - AutoGenerator now obtains the namespace of your custom items
    from the mod id defined in `fabric.mod.json`.
    Make sure that both namespaces match.
    Thus, overriding the namespace programmatically is now effectively no longer possible
    (such as overriding the `minecraft` namespace item sounds that
    predefined in this mod with another mod).<br>
    This change does not affect modifications to `assets/extrasounds/sounds.json` via resource pack.
    Resource pack feature will remain available.
